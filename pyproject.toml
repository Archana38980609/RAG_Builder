description = "RAG_Builder is a mini Netflix-style project where you build a smart search system. Youâ€™ll load a movies dataset, find relevant movies even when the words donâ€™t match exactly, and use an AI model to improve results. The flow is: retrieve matching movies, add that info to a prompt, and generate a clear, helpful answer. Youâ€™ll set up the project with uv, keep data out of git, and end with a simple RAG-powered search you can grow later."
